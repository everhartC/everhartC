### Hello! 
* ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to better my craft and accept wisdom and knowledge pertaining to software and programming in general.<br />
* Recently retired out of the US Army as a First Lieutenant in a Military Intelligence unit. My service time brought me all over the world and provided me with incredible experiences: Airborne/Air Assault School, Advanced Combatives to name of a few. I was in charge of many ISR related tasks and received my Remote Pilot license.
* âš¡ Fun fact: Went to college on a track scholarship.
